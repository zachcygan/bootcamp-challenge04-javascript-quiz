## Description

My motivation for this project is to make a simple javascript quiz that I, and others, and refer to for the basics. For any knowledgeable developer, this will be a very easy quiz.

## Instructions

To begin the game press the start button at any moment, you do not have to reset the game to start again. You may pause the game at any moment by pressing stop. This will stop the timer and prevent any questions from being completed. The reset button will reset the timer and place you on the initial home screen. At the end of a game, whethe the quiz is completed or the timer runs out, the user will be prompted to enter their intials. Their intitials and score will be saved locally. If at any time you would like to view the high scoes, click on high scores on the top left of the page. Whenever a question is answered correctly, the score will increase by 1. However, whenever the question is answered incorrectly, the timer will lose 1 second.
